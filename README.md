Are you a big fan of the [Sensis API](http://developers.sensis.com.au/) and want to do away with the ever-changing landscape of JSON binding in Swift, all while maintaining expressiveness, maintainability and keeping your code really, really good looking? Then check this out:

```
        if let primaryAddress = item.primaryAddress {
            if primaryAddress.addressLine != nil {
                address.text = primaryAddress.addressLine
            }
        }
```
